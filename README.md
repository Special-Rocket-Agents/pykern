Alright, so most of SRA's [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Special-Rocket-Agents/repositories) consist of simulated kernels that we write for fun; 

For demonstration we can name [ChungOS](https://github.com/Special-Rocket-Agents/ChungOS), [ChungOSX](https://github.com/Special-Rocket-Agents/ChungOSX) and PythonOS (Not available, written by [Mini](https://github.com/Iemane291))

There is a _why_ and there is a _what_:
- Why were these even written
- What inspired y'all to do this.

For the 1st one, we don't know. For your 2nd question... **This is why**

Pykern was a repository that randomly appeared in my GitHub, written by Kiffolisk/NitrogenDioxide, and **I fell in love with it**

It gave me excuses to use python and ultimately, open my eyes that, you **can** write things that aren't useful.

And so I made Corn Engine, and ultimately made about 2 PRs to the main Pykern repository.

Then, fast forward a few months later, I met Mini in the [FNF Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) Discord server for a very absurd reason.

We became friends because of our shared programming habits and we created a discord server to plan our ideas, and we ultimately discovered VSC Live Share.

Then the idea of a simulated kernel sparked, I mentioned Pykern and we started to develop ChungOS, name derived from Big Chungus because I knew our code was going to be heavy. SRA did not exist back then, it was [NUGTeam](https://github.com/NUGTeam) (derived from GNU). It blew up back then, we coded everyday using Live Share and debugged everything. We even developed a bot named `py-chan` that did a lot of stuff.

After ChungOS was deemed complete, Mini went for the kill, he made a derivative repository that aimed to rewrite ChungOS, and to make it more lightweight, more user-friendly and less buggy, PythonOS (We might revive that too with permission, we have all the files).

Suffice to say, it all went downhill, I chased other passions, education chased me and Mini stopped programming. It all ended there, it was only a discord conversation.

Most of NUG and Mini's developments are transferred into SRA (with permission) or rewritten with a similar name and the same purpose.

ChungOSX is very partially maintained, so is hookies and others.

With that, I want to thank Kiffolisk/NitrogenDioxide for making all of this possible.

They go under a different name and have removed the Pykern and the SIP package manager repositories.

With the license that it was assigned, I believe it is safe to revive this project and maintain it for aesthetic reasons.

# Pykern
Pykern simulates what would be a command-line operating system if it was written in Python.

It features a juicy setup process and a really juicy package manager called SIP (reportedly stands for **S**uper **I**nstaller **P**ackager)

Installation is currently not documented but it will very soon be. (On wiki)
